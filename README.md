# Alomafit light version

### What is AlomaFit VFR?
- It is a B2B virtual fitting room solution, based on 3D visualization for human body, machine learning and rule-based system to let consumers create 3D avatars for themselves, try on clothes, match pieces together, and see how it will fit on them, besides get size recommendation.
- The consumer can create her/his own profile and add others, in case he always shop for other people.
- In addition, AlomaFit VFR allows the shop owners to understand their customers and monitor their measurements, sizes, body shapes and the most preferred products so that they can manage their stock and product development.

***

### Why it's a good idea to build a light version?
- Shopify has  become so widespread, the majority of its shop owners are at the med level, i.e they sell not to many products, so this app may be targeted for those kind of people who wants to improve their sellings on a day to day basis

***

### How this service could provide value to those shop owners?
- We hope, to entitle shop owner to describe their product more precisely in terms of fitting type, elasticity and give detailed physical descriptions of product's variants, so shoppers can have much confidence in buying those products.

### What is AlomaFit VFR light version?
It has the same functionalities that mentioned in 3D version, but without the following:
1.  The ability of creating a 3D avatar for consumers.
2. Try on clothes, match pieces together.
-  These options will be extra, so that the shop owner can contact us in order to get the 3D avatar in his online store.

##### The light version offers the following
1.  Body shape profile.
2. Size recommendation.
3. stresses on each part of the body, and the ability to check one size up and one down
4. See how the product will fit over consumers bodies.
5. Insights for the shop owners about their customers: measurements, sizes, body shapes, most preferred products.

### What should AlomaFit VFR light version contains?

-  Interface for the consumer to create accounts, enter their measurements, get body profile, and see how products will fit on a vector, which will represent them but will not be resizable as in the 3D avatar.
- Interface for the shop owner to check all the insights of his customers.
- Interface for the shop owner to enter the details of each product.
##### Note
- We should decide first whether our app can access the shopify product page and redesign the page so that the shop admin or owner can instantly enter his product details directly from the product page itself, or we need to go through some other solution for this issue (such as creating a separate C-panel for the app)
- We need to decide if the insights should appear on the home page of shopify or the admin should go through the application C-panel to get all the information he needs.

#### What is a Shopify API?
- Shopify API, lets you pro-grammatically access a shop's data / items for sale, orders and so on, and take most of the actions available to you from a shop's control panel.
